# Lab drivers



## Description

Repository for hardware drivers in EQM lab. The repository is meant to keep organize, documented and on date the lab software. Please be aware that this repository it is meant to future generations, so keep the documentation and code clear and on date.

For creating a new driver or update a current version of a driver please follow the instructions using the dedicated template. Keep good practices of git. Here some introductory material of Git:

## Add your files

- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://git.unistra.fr/cesq/eqm-lab/lab-drivers.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Integrate with your tools

Gitlab have a series of options to integrate services to the repositories and other functionalities, you can have a look here:

- [ ] [Set up project integrations](https://git.unistra.fr/cesq/eqm-lab/lab-drivers/-/settings/integrations)

## Collaborate with your team

Part of using Git is to share a trackable code development, not just for current development but for future projects that might use the code. Try to share with other members:

- [ ] [Invite team members and collaborators](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/)

If you develop a significant improvement or advance you should add it to the repo:
- [ ] [Create a new merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)

Keep good practices and if you solve a bug, be kind and share it:
- [ ] [Automatically close issues from merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically)

It is task of the administrator to keep the repository on shape:
- [ ] [Enable merge request approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/)
- [ ] [Automatically merge when pipeline succeeds](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.html)

## Test and Deploy

Use the built-in continuous integration in GitLab.

- [ ] [Get started with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/index.html)
- [ ] [Analyze your code for known vulnerabilities with Static Application Security Testing(SAST)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/)
- [ ] [Deploy to Kubernetes, Amazon EC2, or Amazon ECS using Auto Deploy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/requirements.html)
- [ ] [Use pull-based deployments for improved Kubernetes management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/)
- [ ] [Set up protected environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html)

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support

You can always get more information through the S.Whitlock (whitlock@unistra.fr)

## Roadmap
