AQiPT: Atomic Quantum information Processing Toolbox
====================================================

AQiPT is an open-source computational tool for the calculation of time-dependent and time-independent simulation of quantum systems, at the theoretical models on the Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA) up to the abstract level of classical control using waveforms. AQiPT is designed to be use at any level of abstraction of the quantum backend.
