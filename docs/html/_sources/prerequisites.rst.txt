Pre-requisites
--------------

Emulator module of AQiPT is powered by Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP) solvers. Kernel module run some calculations from Alkali Rydberg calculator (ARC) and PairInteraction built-in functions. Quantum circuits environment features are based in Qiskit and Other general pre-requisites for running AQiPT are based in standard lybraries of Numpy, SciPy, Matplolib and Plotly.
