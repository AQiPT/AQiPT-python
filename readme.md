# AQiPT: Atomic Quantum information Processing Toolbox
================================


![alt text](https://github.com/manuelmorgado/AQiPT/blob/main/resources/logo/aqipt_logo.png?raw=true)


AQiPT is an friendly open-souce software for bridging theoretical physics and experimental physics in the field of Quantum Information Processing (QIP) with atomic architectures. AQiPT is based in numpy, scipy, matplotlib and other packages such as QuTiP, Qiskit and Labscript.

The goal of AQiPT is to setup a general framework where simulations, quantum circuits and experiments of quantum devices dedicated to QIP, can converge. Allowing to work in general and standard software ecosystem that interfaces the different levels of a quantum software stack.

The open-source nature of AQiPT allows users to customize and/or modify the package at will. Besides, AQiPT is multiplatform i.e., compatible with UNIX and Windows OS. Being free of licensing fees, AQiPT represent an excellent tool to deep into the research and development of quantum information processing and quantum engineering.
